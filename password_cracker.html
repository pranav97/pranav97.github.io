						<h2>Multithreaded Distributed Password Cracker</h2>
						<p>Problems can have many solutions. In the case of the Number of Islands problem there are at least 3 different solutions.</p>

						<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
						<p>Inputs: N number of lowercase 6 character encoded passwords that were generated using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/crypt" >crypt in standard library.</a> </p>
						<p>Example: </br>
                            Input: </br>
							an47aiHfl8mYU </br>
                            dfnPloK4B2dE2 </br>
                            mmgThmekP3YfA </br>
                            ilWX9JLsMJN/M </br>
                            bri2PbcuqAXeA </br>
						</p>
						<p>Output: There was a competition among the people in the class for who can crack the passwords fastest. </p>
						<p>

                            Example output: </br>
                            pranav </br>
                            asdfgh </br>
                            hammer </br>
                            brilli </br>
                            anbran </br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The goal was to brute force the password (that is to try every single password combination until we get the password hash that was provided starting at aaaaaa to zzzzzz. The fastest password crack would use all the 4 CPUs and all the 24 cores each (96 total cores) solving the problem as efficiently as possible.

								<h3>Truely Parallel</h3>
								<p> IF the number of passwords to be cracked is greater than the number of cores. The task of cracking these n passwords is perfect for a truly parallel algorithm in which core would get n / 96 passwords. For example if the number of passwords was 96 * 3 (288) then each core can do 3 passwords. For tasks in which the subtasks are similarly sized, a truly parallel solution might be sufficient.  </p>

                                <h3>Embarrassingly parallel</h3>
                                <p>The issue was that some of the passwords were "easier" than others. So we came up with ways to split the search space of aaaaaa to zzzzzz among the different codes and had the thread with the password to terminate all the threads that are still searching for the password. </p>

								<h3>Union Find or Disjoint-set</h3>
								<p>Union Find is a data structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned into disjoint or non-overlapping subsets. This technique of dividing the components into non-overlapping sets can be used in many problems. For example,</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Finding out the number of connected components in a digital picture.
									</li>
									<li>

										Finding out if there exists a path between two nodes in a network. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Kruskal's algorithm - This greedy algorithm finds the minimum weight spanning tree for a connected graph. A minimum weight spanning tree has all the vertices of the fully connected graph. More importantly, the algorithm minimizes the weights in the graph. In a network situation, the edges in the minimum weight spannning tree might be used over edges that are not since those links have the least cost (take the least time).

								<p>In the case of this grid, all of the land masses or 1s are going to be elements in the disjoint-set data structure. After joining or unifying neighboring sets in the grid, the number of islands in the grid can be found out.</p>
